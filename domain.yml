  utter_faq-20:
  - text: Stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably, and there is overlap between stress and anxiety. Stress is related to the same fight,flight, or freeze response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar. The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we're finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we're stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. Anxiety, on theother hand, isn't always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety aboutthe anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on ourwell-being or daily life.

Other ways to talk aboutsadness might be feeling low, feeling down, or feeling blue.A person may say they are feeling depressed, but if it goes away on its own and doesn'timpact life in a big way, it probably isn't the illness of depression. Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way youunderstand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness orlow mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depressionas anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolatethemselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It's a real illness, and it is very treatable. It's important to seek help if you're concerned about depression.
  utter_faq-9:
  - text: It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children. Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition. Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs).

  - text: There are various symptoms of mental illness that can occur in different age groups.

Substance abuse is also a common symptom in this age group.
  - text: "For younger children, symptoms may include changes in school performance, poor grades despite strong efforts, excessive worrying or anxiety, hyperactivity, persistent nightmares, persistent disobedience and/or aggressive behavior, and frequent temper tantrums. It's important to note that recognizing these symptoms and seeking appropriate treatment can help individuals manage their mental health and improve their quality of life. "
